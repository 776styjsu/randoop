 * A demand-driven approach to construct inputs. Randoop works by selecting a method and then trying
 * to find inputs for that method. Ordinarily, Randoop works bottom-up: if Randoop cannot find
 * inputs for the selected method, it gives up and selects a different method. This demand-driven
 * approach works top-down: if Randoop cannot find inputs for the selected method, then it looks for
 * methods that create values of the necessary type, and iteratively tries to call them.
 *
 * <p>The main entry point is {@link #createSequencesForType}.
 *
 * <p>The demand-driven approach implements the "Detective" component described by the ASE 2015
 * paper <a href="https://people.kth.se/~artho/papers/lei-ase2015.pdf">"GRT: Program-Analysis-Guided
 * Random Testing" by Ma et al.</a>. This is one interpretation of the paper, whose description is

   * Performs a demand-driven approach for constructing input objects of a target type, when the
   * sequence collection of this DemandDrivenInputCreator contains no objects of that type.
   *
   * <p>It starts by identifying all constructors and methods that produce an instance of the target
   * type from the provided {@code targetType}. For each candidate, the algorithm extracts the
   * required parameters and adds types to a worklist for further processing. Processing for a given
   * type stops when it is either a non-receiver type or has already been processed.
   *
   * <p>Once all the necessary parameters for a candidate are available in the provided sequence
   * collection, the method assembles the corresponding execution sequence, executes it, stores the
   * resulting object for future use, and returns the sequence. If no sequences that can produce the
   * target type are found, the method returns an empty list.
   *
   * <p>Here is the demand-driven algorithm in more detail:
   *
   * <ol>
   *   <li>Let producerMethods := empty list
   *   <li>Initialize a worklist with the {@code targetType}.
   *   <li>For each type T in the worklist, until it is empty:
   *       <ul>
   *         <li>Remove T from the worklist.
   *         <li>Continue the loop (skip type T) if T was already processed or if T is a
   *             non-receiver type.
   *         <li>Identify constructors and methods of T that can produce objects of type T or of
   *             type {@code targetType}. Add them to producerMethods.
   *         <li>Add input parameter types of these producer methods to the front of the worklist.
   *       </ul>
   *   <li>For each producer method, try to find sequences for its inputs in the sequence
   *       collection.
   *       <ul>
   *         <li>If inputs are found, create and execute a sequence. Store successful sequences in a
   *             secondary sequence collection.
   *       </ul>
   *   <li>Let result := sequences in the secondary sequence collection that produce objects of the
   *       target type.
   *   <li>Add result to the main sequence collection.
   *   <li>Return result.
   * </ol>
   *
   * <p><b>Invariant:</b> This method is invoked only when the component sequence collection ({@link
   * ComponentManager#gralComponents}) does not contain a sequence that produces an object of a type
   * compatible with the one required by the forward generator, and when the required type cannot be
   * instantiated using any methods from the class under test.
   *
   * <p>Side-effects:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Sequence that can successfully create an object of the target type are added to the main
   *       sequence collection {@link#sequenceCollection}.
   *   <li>If no producer methods are found for the target type, the method logs a warning and adds
   *       the target type to the {@link UninstantiableTypeTracker}.
   *   <li>Types not specified by the user but used in the generation process are added to the
   *       {@link UnspecifiedClassTracker}.
   * </ul>
   *
   * @param targetType the type of objects to create
   * @param exactTypeMatch if true, only sequences that declare values of the exact requested type
   *     are returned; if false, sequences that declare values of subtypes of the requested type are
