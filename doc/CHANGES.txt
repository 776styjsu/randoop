Version 1.3.6, released ??

Command-line-argument --junit-reflection-allowed=false causes
Randoop to avoid use of JUnit's reflective test invocation.  Use of direct method calls instead can make Randoop's generated tests easier to analyze.

Not directly related to Randoop, but possibly of interest to Randoop users:
ABB Corporation has released an improved version of Randoop.NET.  Compared to
the original version of Randoop.NET from Microsoft Research:
 * It fixes some bugs.
 * It adds new features, notably regression assertions for more effective
   regression testing, method transformers to delete or replace calls to
   specific methods in the assembly, and richer debug information collection.
 * It adds a GUI, as a VS2010 add-in.
The Java implementation of Randoop continues to have more features than
Randoop.NET, but ABB's improvements make the .NET tool more usable.


Version 1.3.5, released May 28, 2015

Command-line argument --check-regression-behavior controls whether the tests
include assertions about the current behavior.

Command-line argument --observers lets you provide a file listing observer
functions.

The Randoop homepage is now http://mernst.github.io/randoop/ .

Moved the Randoop version control repository from Google Code to GitHub,
and from the Mercurial version control system to Git.

Randoop now compiles, and its tests pass, under Java 8.

 * String lengths are checked correctly

 * Add troubleshooting section about no tests being created
 * Tips on reporting a bug
 * Documentation for building a release
